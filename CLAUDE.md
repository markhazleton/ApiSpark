## DevSpark Commands

This project uses DevSpark for spec-driven development. Available slash commands:

- `/devspark.release` — Release workflow

## Constitution

Read `.documentation/memory/constitution.md` before making changes — it defines the project's non-negotiable principles.

## Tech Stack

- C# / .NET (ASP.NET Core, Web API)
- API-first: OpenAPI/Swagger contracts defined before implementation
- Test-first: tests written before or alongside implementation
