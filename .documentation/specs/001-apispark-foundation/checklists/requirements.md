# Specification Quality Checklist: ApiSpark Platform Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Frontmatter matches the shared validation contract (classification, risk_level, target_workflow, required_artifacts, recommended_next_step, required_gates all present)
- [x] Required headings for full-spec route are present in canonical order (Rationale Summary, User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria)
- [x] Status line uses a valid lifecycle state (`Draft`)
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) in user scenarios or success criteria
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (user stories use plain language)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous (each FR uses MUST with a specific, verifiable behavior)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (SC-001 has time bound, SC-003 specifies 401 response, SC-006 specifies 10-minute target)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no framework names, no database engine names in SC section)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined (6 user stories with GWT scenarios covering primary flows)
- [x] Edge cases are identified (7 edge cases listed covering startup, slug conflicts, duplicate seeding)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (Phases 0-2 in, Phases 3-9 explicitly out per Decision Summary)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (constitution, Jumpstart Guide, .NET 10 SDK noted in Source Inputs)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (mapped to user stories and SC items)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (health, public content, admin auth boundary, docs, CI/CD, local setup)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification (FR section references behaviors, not code patterns)

## Constitution Compliance

- [x] Single Backend Platform (Principle VII): Spec describes one modular ASP.NET Core application — no microservices
- [x] Clear Authorization Boundaries (Principle VIII): FR-003 through FR-006 map directly to the constitution's route authorization table
- [x] Relational-First Data Strategy (Principle IX): FR-010 through FR-017 enforce SQLite as default; no Cosmos in foundation scope
- [x] Zero Secrets in Source Control (Principle X): FR-023 explicitly prohibits secrets in source control
- [x] API-First (Principle I): FR-007 requires OpenAPI/Swagger contracts in development
- [x] Test-First (Principle II): FR-025 requires CI/CD tests; SC-004 is a measurable test-pass criterion
- [x] Simplicity (Principle III): Scope limited to Phases 0-2; no premature CMS, Cosmos, or publishing features
- [x] Security by Default (Principle IV): FR-004 through FR-006 enforce route-level authorization boundaries
- [x] Spec-Driven Development (Principle V): This spec follows specify → plan → tasks → implement workflow

## Clarification Pass (2026-05-07)

Five clarification questions asked and answered. Spec updated in the following areas:

| # | Question | Decision | Sections Updated |
|---|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Q1 | Article list pagination? | No pagination; summary fields only in list | FR-018, User Story 2 |
| Q2 | API versioning prefix? | No versioning; `/api/public/...` canonical | FR-002, FR-002a |
| Q3 | Article body format? | Markdown (raw string) | FR-021 |
| Q4 | Tags endpoint in scope? | Yes — `GET /api/public/content/tags` added | FR-020a, User Story 2 |
| Q5 | Logging fields (§16 alignment)? | Full §16 alignment — all 9 fields required | FR-009 |

## Notes

- All checklist items pass post-clarification. Spec is ready for `/devspark.plan`.
- Clarifications section added with exactly 5 bullets — one per accepted answer.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain in spec.
- Admin CRUD endpoints (Phases 3-4) are intentionally out of scope; only the authorization boundary is established.
- Cosmos DB configuration is intentionally out of scope for this foundation spec.
