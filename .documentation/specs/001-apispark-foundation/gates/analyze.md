## Findings

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| C1 | Inconsistency | HIGH | tasks.md Phase 5 (T029, T031) | T029 creates `AuthorizationBoundaryTests.cs` which depends on `TestAuthHandler` (T031), but T031 is numbered after T029 — executing in order leaves tests uncompilable until T031 completes | Renumber: T029→TestAuthHandler infrastructure, T030→AuthorizationBoundaryTests, T031→AdminHealthEndpoints.cs; or add explicit dependency note "T031 is a prerequisite for T029" |
| U1 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | tasks.md T016; spec.md Edge Cases | Spec edge case "EF Core migrations fail at startup" has no handling task or test. T016 calls `db.Database.Migrate()` with no explicit error path or startup abort logic documented | Extend T016 task description to include try/catch + `ILogger<Program>` CRITICAL log + application abort on migration failure |
| U2 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | tasks.md T016; spec.md Edge Cases | Spec edge case "`/home/data/` path not writable in Azure App Service" has no task addressing detection or error messaging | Extend T016 or add a validation step that checks directory writability before calling `db.Database.Migrate()`; log a clear CRITICAL message if path is inaccessible |
| U3 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | tasks.md Phase 2; spec.md FR-009 | FR-009 specifies 9 structured logging fields. T012 implements the middleware but no test task validates that all 9 fields are present in logged output | Add a middleware test task (e.g., T012a) in Phase 2 Foundational using a test logger sink to assert required fields are present |
| I1 | Inconsistency | LOW | tasks.md T015; plan.md Setup | T015 runs `dotnet ef migrations add` but no task ensures `dotnet-ef` global tool or tools manifest is installed. Missing tool causes an unclear build failure | Add T001a: create `.config/dotnet-tools.json` with `dotnet-ef` entry and include `dotnet tool restore` in Setup phase; add `dotnet tool restore` step to CI workflows (T034, T035) |
| A1 | Ambiguity | LOW | spec.md SC-001; tasks.md T018 | SC-001 requires health response in "< 500ms including cold starts." T018 tests correctness but not timing. Untestable acceptance criterion without explicit measurement | Add optional `Stopwatch` timing assertion in T018 (`Assert.True(elapsed.TotalMilliseconds < 500, "Health response exceeded 500ms")`) |
| A2 | Ambiguity | LOW | tasks.md T044; spec.md SC-008 | T044 reviews appsettings files for secrets but does not scan git history. SC-008 requires "no secrets in git history" | Extend T043/T044 to include `git log --all --full-history --diff-filter=A -- "*.env" "*.pfx" "*.p12"` scan; also confirm no connection strings with passwords exist in any historical commit |
| A3 | Ambiguity | LOW | tasks.md T035; spec.md SC-005 | SC-005 (SQLite persists across redeployments) has no verification step in the deploy workflow. The deploy.yml doesn't include `/home/data/` in the artifact, but there's no post-deploy health check confirming data survived | Add a post-deploy smoke test step to `deploy.yml` (e.g., `curl https://api.markhazleton.com/api/health`) |
| A4 | Ambiguity | LOW | tasks.md T021; contracts/public-content.yaml | contracts/public-content.yaml specifies `application/problem+json` for 404 responses. T021 asserts status code 404 but does not verify `Content-Type: application/problem+json` response header | Add content-type assertion to T021: `Assert.Equal("application/problem+json", response.Content.Headers.ContentType?.MediaType)` |

## Constitution Alignment Issues

**None.** All 10 constitution principles are fully satisfied by the spec, plan, and tasks:

- Principle I (API-First): Contracts in `contracts/` defined before implementation ✅
- Principle II (Test-First): Test tasks (T018, T020–T021, T029, T032, T036) precede implementation tasks within each story ✅
- Principle III (Simplicity): Two-project layout; no premature abstractions; no Repository pattern where not warranted ✅
- Principle IV (Security by Default): Auth policies registered day one; CORS locked; no wildcard ✅
- Principle V (Spec-Driven): spec.md exists and is complete; workflow respected ✅
- Principle VI (Ownership Boundary): `.devspark/` untouched; all artifacts in `.documentation/` ✅
- Principle VII (Single Backend Platform): One ASP.NET Core project; no microservices ✅
- Principle VIII (Auth Boundaries): Route groups match constitution authorization table exactly ✅
- Principle IX (Relational-First): EF Core + SQLite only; no Cosmos ✅
- Principle X (Zero Secrets): Gitignore + config pattern + deploy workflow (T001, T008–T009, T043, T044) ✅

## Unmapped Tasks

All 48 tasks map to at least one requirement, user story, or success criterion.

| Task | Maps To |
|------|---------|
| T045 (quickstart.md validation) | US6 / SC-006 |
| T046 (data/.gitkeep) | FR-016 |
| T047 (full test run) | FR-025 (CI requirement validates all tests pass) |
| T048 (zero-warning build) | Engineering quality gate, FR-025 |

No truly unmapped tasks.

## Next Actions

**1 HIGH issue (C1) should be corrected in tasks.md before starting `/devspark.implement`:**
- Fix the T029/T031 ordering: TestAuthHandler infrastructure must be created before the test that uses it.

**3 MEDIUM issues can be addressed by extending existing task descriptions** (not new tasks required):
- U1: Add startup migration error handling note to T016
- U2: Add path writability check note to T016
- U3: Add a logging middleware test task (T012a)

**5 LOW issues are improvement suggestions** — safe to proceed without resolving:
- I1: Add dotnet-tools.json to Setup phase
- A1: Add timing assertion to health test
- A2: Add git history scan to Polish phase
- A3: Add post-deploy smoke test to deploy.yml
- A4: Add Content-Type assertion to T021

**Suggested commands:**
- Fix C1: Manually edit `tasks.md` to swap T029 and T031 ordering in Phase 5
- For U1/U2: Extend T016 task description in `tasks.md`
- For U3: Add T012a logging test task to Phase 2 Foundational in `tasks.md`
- Then run `/devspark.critic` to challenge assumptions before implementation
